# Building Serverless Web Applications
This is the code repository for [Building Serverless Web Applications](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-serverless-web-applications?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787126473), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book was designed for web developers who want to use cloud services to be more
productive, reducing the time wasted on configuration and maintenance of the
infrastructure or for developers who want to build solutions using existing services to solve
common problems with very little effort.
Also, as I work as a full-stack developer, my job requires me to understand a little bit of
everything such as frontend, backend, databases, security, and DevOps. So I tried to give in
this book a broad view of web development using the serverless concept. If you have a
similar role or, at least, want to learn more about the different layers of web development,
this book will suit you well.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
class HelloReact extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello, {this.props.name}!</div>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloReact name="World" />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

This book assumes previous knowledge of web development using JavaScript and Node.js.
While you have many options of programming languages to develop a serverless
application, all code examples of this book uses Node, so some basic knowledge of Node.js
is necessary at least to understand how npm and the JavaScript ES6 syntax are used.
There are many cloud providers that offer serverless services, but this book focuses on
AWS. You don't need to have prior knowledge of AWS because we will cover the basics too,
but you will need to create an account to develop and test the code examples. If it is a brand
new account, AWS offers a free tier of 12 months for you to learn and develop without any
cost.
